Select quotes from the following essay. I found this website - [flashpoint](https://flashpointmag.com/) - searching for [[Post-language\|Post-language]]. After reading on the aforementioned subject I looked at their most recent issue - Summer 2016 - and this is the first article I have read from it. It is a David Jones special issue, a poet-painter I have not heard of before. He seems interesting, and I appreciated the following insights into a kind of amorphous Celtic sensibility. I was particularly struck by the mention of a "half-aquatic world", which is something I find myself haunted by, that I intend to explore further in future, my working title is Sunday Underwater, it is to be an adventure with the people of Sirendos.

## David Jones and the Celtic Tradition in English Literature By Thomas Dilworth

https://www.flashpointmag.com/dilworthcelt.pdf

> *I am persuaded that there is a valid “Welsh” strain in English Lit & tradition which is rather, perhaps, now, overlooked. It is obscure & not easily defined—but I mean it was present with Camden & Drayton & those people—& Milton felt it (although I’m glad he did not do his proposed “Arthuriad,” except that it might have stopped Tennyson doing his!). Blake certainly was aware of it, & the PreRaphaelites in their way—but already a bit tinged with that horrible “Celtic twilight” idea. Perhaps the “Teutonic” school of the 19th Cent. historians did a good bit to break the continuity of the thing I mean in one sense. For them, the History of the Island began with the landing of the Saxon pirates; and Ebbsflet became more sacred than Glastonbury—but this was a new thing & I imagine was a point of view that would have surprised Shakespeare.*

> *The spirit & mood of the early Welsh fragments (which ... I only know by translation—& I suspect, not very good translation) is one of “realism” of a kind—a kind of caustic observation & rather amused bitterness—but resigned also—rather more in the mood of those very early warrior Chinese poems that Arthur Waley has translated.*

> *what distinguishes this native prose-tale (Culwch and Olwen) from the subsequent great medieval Arthurian Romance-Cycles is its vivid sense of the particular, the actual, the tangible. The exact topography and terrain is in strong contrast to the vague and generalized topography of the Romances .... So that though it is interweaved with marvels & mysterious powers, the narrative reads in a perfectly matter-of-fact fashion.*

> *I should like to speak of a quality which I rather associate with the folk-tales of Welsh or other Celtic derivation, a quality congenial and significant to me which in some oblique way has some connection with what I want in painting. I find it impossible to define, but it has to do with a certain affection for the intimate creatureliness of things—a care for, and appreciation of, the particular genius of places, men, trees, animals, and yet withal a pervading sense of metamorphosis and mutability. That trees are men walking. That words “bind and loose material things.” I think Carroll’s Alice Books and the Hunting of the Snark inherit, through what channel I do not know, something akin to this particular quality of the Celtic tales. The Snark is always a Boojum in Celtic legend, and tragically so in much Celtic history. The Hunting of the Snark has for me an affinity to the Gododdin of Aneurin and the Hunting of the Boar Trwyth in the Olwen tale, and the Grail Quest also.*

> *There should be always a bit of lion in your lamb.*

> Celtic influence could be detected, he thought, in works of English literature that had vividness of imagery and a woven texture, an emerging and disappearing movement “like tangled brush with cats coming & going.” He saw this texture in “all of Julian of Norwich,” in Malory where Lancelot visits Chapel Perilous, in much of Shakespeare, in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, in the verse at the end of “Christabel,” and in the writings of Lewis Carroll

> *The folk tradition of the insular Celts seems to present to the mind a half-aquatic world—it is one of its most fascinating characteristics—it introduces a feeling of transparency and interpenetration of one element with another, of transposition and metamorphosis. The hedges of mist vanish or come again under the application of magic, such as Geraint ab Erbin encountered, just as the mists over peat-bog and tarn and traeth disclose or lose before our eyes drifting stumps and tussocks. It is unstable, the islands float, where a caer or a llys now is a glassy expanse.*

> *even I have this feeling of wanting to include ‘everything’; ‘the whole’ in such works as I’ve tried to make ... I mean the entirety or totality in a little place or space*

> To him, truly English (at heart Celtic) works are
> 
> *always a loving “handled” “textured” free-flowing affair with a bit of thunder-storm-  behind-an-apple-tree—linear-tentative—not large—packed with life a bit of a joke— speckled—like a large thrush’s breast & spear points in a garden. ... It is the work of a motley race with Kent gardens & Capel-y-ffin darknesses within a day’s walk ...—it’s a patch-work quilt in a way, on the bed of a princess with a dead dog on the mat.*

> Aesthetic literary Britishness survived, he thought, in the common songs where roses, death and bridal nights are vitally, incongruously joined. The real thing is there “to make you weep,” he said, in the early medieval works; then becomes heavy and dull in the later Middle Ages; then, with Shakespeare and the Metaphysical poets, “happy, prouder, conscious, & having a regular fine old fling.”

> He regarded the love of small, “deep down things,” which Hopkins celebrated, as distinctively Celtic and right. Each exists for its own sake, subsumed in a larger relaxed unity, which is not dominating or controlling in a way that diminishes the small parts. In this regard, his paintings express love, not power. It is a form not so much imagined or given as discovered, partly by accident, through judicious muddling and, in Jones, the least dictatorial of sensibilities.
