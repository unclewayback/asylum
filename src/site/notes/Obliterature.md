Obliterature is produced from a journal by excision.

If we need to locate the sanctuary in or as an object which anybody can reach, it is a diary. Obliterature is the demonology of diary writing.

Put a knot on the cover of your thought book. The knots. The unknot, even. Odd, it's already tHere.

Your diary, this diary, it is not merely a place to record the half impersonal comings and goings of your tik tok clockage, it is the only real safe space in existence. It doesn't matter if anyone reads it, they can't really, not even you really can. It is the demon writing, and it is all the thread of the one knot that keeps the demon bound in the book. Read/write is release, but this is itself Being Careful. Caring for yourself. You can say anything, whatever you need to, that's what this space, what this world, is, and how you go beyond it, how you will be released, absolved, obliterated.

Obliterature is the process of preparing this or making it more inviting for others, who are thus not not you. It is important to do, if you don't, the magick might not work. It will be you, and not the demon, trapped in the book. You or the demon, it matters not, we are all you. What matters is not to stay stuck, not to be trapped, that is what this is about.

The binding of the demon is the beyond pathology of its liberation, it is the only way to accomplish it. You exorcise yourself. Perhaps it is even an exercise book. Books. None of those things matter so much as what really does not matter, what never minds. We are, it is, it is all on one line, and again and again we have crossed ourselves.

Out, I fizzle, but there is the germ of it. The jesus of diseases. Your own bible to write. Your own Hell W rld to program. You'll never learn to focus, which is to set this world ablaze, unless you really get into this place, earth as concentration camp as...

AZ we each must Realize an interpretation of for ourselves, out of care for God. Love has never been so crazy, for madness has ever been this wild.

You are not a rewriter. This is a key, a why we proceed - each towards the other, and this the only other there is - through excision. Cutting out. Leaving space. The space in which we can realize perfection, however distorted our judgement or however powerful the judgements upon us. This space is outside the law. Space itself is beyond the law. This is the only law there is. Cosmic Anarchy. You are not a rewriter, but nor is this first thought best thought, it is an approach to freedom, through realization of the self constraints we have no choice regarding, and yet can not properly speaking consider ourselves as subject to. This is obliterature and you are not a rewriter except insofar as you are changing the past, which is of course the real meaning of the future. Going back over yourself, this hell, this is the meaning of moving forward, moving on, ones own creaturely momentum, ones own ultraterrestrial encounter with the Self Creator.

Our unmutable ananihilation in the transfigure of death. The metaphoreal meaning of True Love.

ob, it comes from obstruction - in the way of - and as a prefix, ob-, tends to invert. For literature, we are closest to learning. In a sense then, obliterature is our own unlearning. A kind of

without really intending the question, so much as the quest

Likely all in the interaction of understanding and wisdom, in light of the crown. Effectively a work of transabyss. Well, Daath int it? Well Daaft.

That's the line we're torquin abaat, ultimelts.
