Obliterature is produced from a journal by excision.

If we need to locate the sanctuary in or as an object which anybody can reach, it is a diary. Obliterature is the demonology of diary writing.

Put a knot on the cover of your thought book. The knots. The unknot, even. Odd, it's already tHere.

Your diary, this diary, it is not merely a place to record the half impersonal comings and goings of your tik tok clockage, it is the only real safe space in existence. It doesn't matter if anyone reads it, they can't really, not even you really can. It is the demon writing, and it is all the thread of the one knot that keeps the demon bound in the book. Read/write is release, but this is itself Being Careful. Caring for yourself. You can say anything, whatever you need to, that's what this space, what this world, is, and how you go beyond it, how you will be released, absolved, obliterated.

Obliterature is the process of preparing this or making it more inviting for others, who are thus not not you. It is important to do, if you don't, the magick might not work. It will be you, and not the demon, trapped in the book. You or the demon, it matters not, we are all you. What matters is not to stay stuck, not to be trapped, that is what this is about.

The binding of the demon is the beyond pathology of its liberation

ob, it comes from obstruction - in the way of - and as a prefix, ob-, tends to invert. When we say literature, we are close to saying *learning*. In a sense then, obliterature is our own *unlearning*. Well Da**ath**ft.
